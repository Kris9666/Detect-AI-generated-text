       "\"Car-free cities have become a subject of increasing interest and debate in recent years, as urban areas around the world grapple with the challenges of congestion, pollution, and limited resources. The concept of a car-free city involves creating urban environments where private automobiles are either significantly restricted or completely banned, with a focus on alternative transportation methods and sustainable urban planning. This essay explores the benefits, challenges, and potential solutions associated with the idea of car-free cities.  Benefits of Car-Free Cities  Environmental Sustainability: Car-free cities promote environmental sustainability by reducing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Fewer cars on the road mean cleaner air and a significant decrease in the contribution to global warming.  Improved Public Health: A reduction in automobile usage can lead to better public health outcomes. Fewer cars on the road result in fewer accidents and a safer urban environment for pedestrians and cyclists. Moreover, less air pollution can lead to reduced respiratory and cardiovascular problems.  Efficient Use of Space: Car-free cities utilize urban space more efficiently. Parking lots and wide roads can be repurposed for green spaces, parks, and pedestrian zones, enhancing the overall quality of life in the city.  Reduced Traffic Congestion: By eliminating or restricting car usage, traffic congestion is significantly reduced, leading to faster commute times and less frustration for residents and commuters.  Cost Savings: Car ownership and maintenance can be expensive. Car-free cities allow residents to save money on vehicles, fuel, and insurance, improving their overall financial well-being.  Challenges of Car-Free Cities  Resistance to Change: Transitioning to a car-free city can face resistance from citizens, especially those who rely heavily on their cars for daily activities and commutes.  Public Transportation Infrastructure: An effective public transportation system is crucial for the success of car-free cities. Cities need to invest in and expand their public transportation networks to ensure that people have viable alternatives to cars.  Economic Impact: Businesses that rely on car-dependent customers may experience a decline in revenue in a car-free city. It's essential to address this economic impact and find ways to support affected businesses during the transition.  Urban Planning and Infrastructure: The redesign of urban areas for car-free living requires significant planning and investment in infrastructure, which can be a lengthy and complex process.  Solutions for Car-Free Cities  Expand Public Transportation: Invest in the expansion and improvement of public transportation systems to provide convenient and affordable alternatives to private cars.  Promote Active Transportation: Encourage walking and cycling by building bike lanes, pedestrian-friendly streets, and ensuring safe infrastructure for these activities.  Implement Carpooling and Ride-Sharing: Promote carpooling and ride-sharing services to reduce the number of private vehicles on the road.  Adopt Electric and Sustainable Transportation: Encourage the use of electric vehicles and promote sustainability by using renewable energy sources to power transportation.  Education and Public Awareness: Educate citizens about the benefits of a car-free city and involve them in the planning process to increase support and understanding.  Conclusion  Car-free cities represent a vision for a sustainable and healthier urban future. While the transition to a car-free city is not without challenges, the potential benefits in terms of environmental sustainability, public health, and efficient urban living make it a compelling goal. Through a combination of investment in public transportation, promotion of alternative transportation methods, and public engagement, cities can work towards a future where cars are no longer the dominant mode of transportation. Car-free cities offer a promising vision of a more sustainable and vibrant urban environment.\""

       "\"Car-free cities have become a subject of increasing interest and debate in recent years, as urban areas around the world grapple with the challenges of congestion, pollution, and limited resources. The concept of a car-free city involves creating urban environments where private automobiles are either significantly restricted or completely banned, with a focus on alternative transportation methods and sustainable urban planning. This essay explores the benefits, challenges, and potential solutions associated with the idea of car-free cities.  Benefits of Car-Free Cities  Environmental Sustainability: Car-free cities promote environmental sustainability by reducing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Fewer cars on the road mean cleaner air and a significant decrease in the contribution to global warming.  Improved Public Health: A reduction in automobile usage can lead to better public health outcomes. Fewer cars on the road result in fewer accidents and a safer urban environment for pedestrians and cyclists. Moreover, less air pollution can lead to reduced respiratory and cardiovascular problems.  Efficient Use of Space: Car-free cities utilize urban space more efficiently. Parking lots and wide roads can be repurposed for green spaces, parks, and pedestrian zones, enhancing the overall quality of life in the city.  Reduced Traffic Congestion: By eliminating or restricting car usage, traffic congestion is significantly reduced, leading to faster commute times and less frustration for residents and commuters.  Cost Savings: Car ownership and maintenance can be expensive. Car-free cities allow residents to save money on vehicles, fuel, and insurance, improving their overall financial well-being.  Challenges of Car-Free Cities  Resistance to Change: Transitioning to a car-free city can face resistance from citizens, especially those who rely heavily on their cars for daily activities and commutes.  Public Transportation Infrastructure: An effective public transportation system is crucial for the success of car-free cities. Cities need to invest in and expand their public transportation networks to ensure that people have viable alternatives to cars.  Economic Impact: Businesses that rely on car-dependent customers may experience a decline in revenue in a car-free city. It's essential to address this economic impact and find ways to support affected businesses during the transition.  Urban Planning and Infrastructure: The redesign of urban areas for car-free living requires significant planning and investment in infrastructure, which can be a lengthy and complex process.  Solutions for Car-Free Cities  Expand Public Transportation: Invest in the expansion and improvement of public transportation systems to provide convenient and affordable alternatives to private cars.  Promote Active Transportation: Encourage walking and cycling by building bike lanes, pedestrian-friendly streets, and ensuring safe infrastructure for these activities.  Implement Carpooling and Ride-Sharing: Promote carpooling and ride-sharing services to reduce the number of private vehicles on the road.  Adopt Electric and Sustainable Transportation: Encourage the use of electric vehicles and promote sustainability by using renewable energy sources to power transportation.  Education and Public Awareness: Educate citizens about the benefits of a car-free city and involve them in the planning process to increase support and understanding.  Conclusion  Car-free cities represent a vision for a sustainable and healthier urban future. While the transition to a car-free city is not without challenges, the potential benefits in terms of environmental sustainability, public health, and efficient urban living make it a compelling goal. Through a combination of investment in public transportation, promotion of alternative transportation methods, and public engagement, cities can work towards a future where cars are no longer the dominant mode of transportation. Car-free cities offer a promising vision of a more sustainable and vibrant urban environment.\""

For example, many people in colombia used public transportation during a car free day \"leaving the streets of this capital city \", according to Andrew Selsky, \"eerily devoid of traffic jams\". The complications that stem from traffic jams end with a feeling of confidence. The plan to get from point A to B was more simple just a second ago. This complication in your personal plans leads you to become stressed as a feeling of doubt overcomes all thoughts. If car usage was limited, there would be a control on how much traffic accumulates thus minimizing chance of stress. As Heidrun Walter states \"when i had a car i was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way\". not only does car usage minimize conditions detrimental to health, it also enlarges your capacity for exercise. The main purpose of the car is to get someone from one place to another. when an important job takes over your personal life, it becomes difficult to do things most enjoyed in life. limits on car usage forces you to stay in shape. According to Andrew Selsky \"parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city\". Less cars means healthier and natural situations. With parks and sport centers becoming more efficient, it becomes easier to find a more physically active population. Overall, less usage on cars minimizes stress and increases health.\\n\\nSecondly, limting car usage becomes beneficial to the environment. Now a days people have become annoyed with others who care so passionately about the environment. If you look behind their constant cries for action, there are solid facts. Yespollution is bad for the environment. Yes a bad envorment means unhealthy living. Yes cars are one of the main contributors to pollution in the environment. A pattern of less car usage, as Elisabeth Rosenthal states \"will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment\". The less use of cars, the less pollution in the environment. One must observe limiting car usage as an opportunity to create a cleaner world and better future. The effects of pollution in the environment is completley dangerous and we, the car users, are to blame.\\n\\nAdditionally, it would lower the dependence on cars. Many people today find that their car is so useful. While it has many features and is a form of transportation, many do not figure what they would do if they did not have such a possesion. The development of people and their interaction with technology has left a wide gap between historic, natural ways and what is thought of as modern society. Being dependent is not always good for individuals. As david goldberg says \"all our development since world war II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change\". Many people could disagree and wonder why it is necessary to change our ways especially if we are so highly devloped. If being developed means being dependent on a harmful machine, then it could not be effective devlopment. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal \"cashstrapped americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed were\\'t going to work anyway\". Many people can\\'t have the precious luxury of private transportation in the first place. Those who have had it have become distant to a more natural society. Peope have become so use to having cars that they have become oblivious to the significant effects. With limits on car usage , these effcts could be controlled.\\n\\nTo conclude, the advantages of limiting car usage is an increase in health, along with a decrease in pollution, and less dependence on cars. limiting car usage is a positive way to enfore an organized and clean environment, and ensure health and security of those who live in it. This is one reason America can be reffered to as a succesful country. It is not that America has decreased use of vehicles, but the fact that they have done what is best for majority.']\n",

Park et al.24, proposed an key point detection method which enhanced the accuracy on the 1000 tattoo images. Experimental result has shown that the method is superior than the SIFT key point. A two level illumination estimation framework is proposed by Zhang et al.25. Experimental result shows the satisfactory performance against various datasets. Min et al.26, presented the possibility to explore face recognition in the presence of partial occlusions such as sunglass and scakrf. The proposed method identified the occluded parts t the pixel level and applying face recognition on nonocclued parts only. Experimental result shows that the proposed method is superior to KLD-LGBPHS, S-LNME, OA-LBP and RSC. Cassio et al.27, proposed five approach to determine whether the subject of test sample is enrolled in face gallery. Out of these approaches, three have been presented a good result. The approaches have been identified on feature explored in the data, scalability and accuracy. For face recognition the approaches have been tested on standard databases namely FRGC and Pubfig83. Various assumptions has been made by the authors before the approaches apply on the datasets. Indhumathi et al.28, proposed an algorithm for face detection using distance images. The effectiveness of the recognizing blurred and poorly well-lighted faces are also addressed by the author and shown good recognition rate than LBP operator. Bhattacharjee29, presented an automatic face recognition system using adaptive polar transformation and wavelet based fusion method. In which visual and thermal face images have been effectively combined by the fusion method on robust manner. Experimental result has shown good performance in recognizing against various possible complicacies. A Component based representation in automated face recognition has been demonstrated by Bonnen et al.30. Experimental result shown that the method is robust to change in facial pose, and recognition accuracy on occulded face is enhanced in forensic scenarios.\"]\n",
